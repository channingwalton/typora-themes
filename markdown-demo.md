# Neon Theme

A dark, theme.

**Lorem Ipsum** is simply dummy text of the printing and  typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of  type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not  only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,  remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with  the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker  including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## Code

### Inline Code

Use `const variable = value;` for inline code.

### Code Block

function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

console.log(fibonacci(10));
```

## Mathematics (LaTeX)

### Inline Maths

The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ and Euler's identity is $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$.

### Block Maths

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
$$

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
$$
